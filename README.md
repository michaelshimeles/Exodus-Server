## Lessons Learned

When building Exodus, the thesis behind this project was to present as much actionable data to the end user to make sound and educated decisions.

The lessons I've learned are as follows:

- Planning is just as important as development (at least if you want a smooth dev experience)
- Always assuming requests will fail and planning what to do when the request fails 
- Managing various 3rd party apis and filtering good information
